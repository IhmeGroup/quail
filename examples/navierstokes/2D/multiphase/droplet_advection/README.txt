Advection of a liquid droplet in air.

Test case for validation of isolated interface. No viscous effects, gravitational forces and surface tension. 

To run test case:

../quail/src/quail bubble.py

For post-processing run:

../quail/src/quail create_anim.py

create_anim.py plots a given field in the domain. You can either keep the plt.show() on to see very time step, or commenting it, you can create an animation of the given field.

The file probex.py plots all the most relevant fields along the x direction.
